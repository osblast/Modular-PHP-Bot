osBlast PHP IRC Bot
===================

Welcome to osBlast's PHP IRC Bot Project.  Our IRC Bot project is worked on as a side-project from our main framework,
and is a great little tool for those interested in how the IRC protocol works, but not only that, it is also a great
little tool to use if you'd like a handy, flexible and easy way to develop and maintain your own support channel
IRC bot.

It allows for multiple bots to be created in the same directory (as you will see in the demonstration bot DemoBot).  The
DemoBot code basically shows how functions are written and how plugins are accessed and used.

As of version 2.0.0, we've released the BitBucket updater plugin, which allows BitBucket repository users to ability
to update their IRC support channel of their changes to the repository (ie, commits, pulls, merges, etc).

So download, give it a go, and if you'd like to contribute see the contribution information below.


Contribute
==========

We welcome developers from all skill levels, all walks of life and all areas of expertise to help out with the project.
After all, it is a project written to make things easier for everyone to understand how the IRC protocol works, and how
you can create your very own IRC Bot in PHP.

So come have a chat with us on Freenode IRC, by connecting to irc.freenode.net and jumping into #osBlast.  You'l see me
there idling most of the time (anthonym), however because I am in Australia, I'm on Daylight-savings Australian Eastern-
Standard Time.

So if I don't reply, just leave me a message and I'll get back to you as soon as I'm around!


Bugs / Issues
=============
We very much appreciate our users reporting bugs and issues to us, and we'd love to hear from you if you're experiencing
an issue.  What we do ask though, is if you could create an Issue here on the GitHUB project (create issue from the -
"Issues" menu above) first, because this gives us an ISSUE Number that we can work with - and it also allows you to 
report the bug properly, where you can show examples (copied/pasted etc) that you couldn't otherwise easily show us on 
IRC.

Plugins
=======
If you would like to author a plugin for osPHPBot, we welcome and encourage you to give it a go!  Check out the Demo
Plugin in the repository's plugin folder.  The Demo Plugin will show you the internal structure of the class, and 
what base class you need to extend from.

If you'd like us to include your plugin in the live repository - we welcome you to come and have a chat with us about
it!  We will eventually have a Wiki setup for plugin contributions where other members of the community can request
plugin functionality, and can also contribute to the community, and show their plugins off for vote/approval.

Stay tuned on this, we'l update you as soon as we have the wiki setup!


So download it, enjoy, give it a go, and if you have any comments/suggestions/feedback let us know!

Thankyou!
Anthony (Founder/osBlast)
